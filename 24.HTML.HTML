        <p>   A traditional Savitri and Satyavan mythological legend is told behind this fast. [7] Many years ago, 
            a king named Ashwapati ruled the land of Bhadra. He had a daughter named Savitri. Savitri was a very beautiful,
             humble and talented girl. When Savitri became pregnant, the king allowed her to choose her husband.
Savitri chose a prince named Satyavan. Satyavan was the son of a blind king named Dhritsena of the Shalva kingdom.
 The king lived in the forest with his queen and son as he was defeated by the enemy. Lord Narada knew that Satyavan
 's life was only one year, so he advised Savitri not to marry him. But Savitri did not accept it. She married 
 Satyavana and came to the forest and started serving her mother-in-law with her husband.
When Satyavana's death came to three days, she started Savitri Vrat by fasting for three days.
 Savitri accompanied Satyavan when he went out to cut wood in the forest. He was surrounded by 
 cutting wood and fell to the ground. Yamadharma came there and started taking the life of Satyavan.
  Savitri started following Yama with her husband. Yama asked Savitri to go back on several occasions.
   But she flatly refused and insisted on going with her husband. Finally, tired, Yama left her husband
    and asked her to ask for three. Savitri asked for the eyes and kingdom of her mother-in-law back and 
    asked for a boon that she should have a son. Yamaraja said Tathastu with a miscalculation. Then he
     remembered being committed and had to return Satyavan's life. Savitri regained satyavana's life under 
     the banyan tree, so on the full moon in the month of Jyeshtha, women worship the banyan tree and fast 
     and observe Vat Savitri Vrat. [
