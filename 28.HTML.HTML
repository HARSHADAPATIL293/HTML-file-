      4 stories about Lord Ganesha you probably didn't know
      </h1>
    <h2 id="elephanthead">
      1. The elephant head
      </h2>
    <h3>
      It's said that Lord Ganesha's mother, Goddess Parvati, carved an idol of a boy out of turmeric powder and
       breathed life into it, unbeknownst to her husband, Lord Shiva.

So, when Ganesha denied Lord Shiva entry into his abode--because Goddess Parvati was bathing
 inside--Shiva decapitated Ganesha's head in anger. According to legend, an elephant was the 
 first animal that Lord Brahma later found when he went out to look for one (to replace Ganesha's head).

      2. Writing the Mahabhrata
      </h2>
    <h3>
      It's said that Ganesha wrote the Mahabharata, as it was recited to him by sage Vyasa (Veda Vyasa).
       According to Lifehacker, this was done on the condition that Vyasa would not stop while reciting the epic 
       and that Ganesha would not stop while writing, besides the condition that Ganesha would not merely write it,
        but also understand every verse of it. Popular legends say that it took both of them three years of 
        continuous speaking and writing to complete the epic.

      3. The half-tusk
      </h2>
    <h3>
      If you've ever noticed the idol of Lord Ganesha carefully, you'd have noticed the broken tusk.
       As legend goes, when Ganesha was writing the Mahabharata, the feather he was writing with broke. 
       So, to stick to the condition of writing continuously, Ganesha broke his tusk and wrote with it.

Some are also of the belief that Lord Parashurama cut off one of Ganesha's tusks because he didn't allow 
him to enter the Shiva abode and meet Lord Shiva, who was busy praying, according to Lifehacker.

      4. Mouse as his vehicle
      </h2>
    <h3>
      Now, there are two theories to this:

First, in ancient times, when agriculture was the primary mode of sustenance, rodents were one of the biggest 
obstacles to prosperity--as they are for farmers even today. Destroying crops, eating stored grains are all in
 a day's work for a rodent. Lord Ganesha, in having a mouse/rat as his vehicle, is symbolically shown to have 
 conquered this pest, thus staying true to his name and work as the destroyer of obstacles, according to
  biodiversity of India.

Second, Lord Ganesha was able to reach all the nooks and crannies of the world--and do his duty as the destroyer
 of obstacles--because his vehicle was a mouse--because mice/rats can slither through tiny holes and narrow pathways.

        1.Ganesh Chaturthi
      </h1>
    <h3>
      Ganesh Chaturthi, also called Vinayaka Chaturthi, in Hinduism, 10-day festival marking the 
      birth of the elephant-headed deity Ganesha, the god of prosperity and wisdom. It begins on 
      the fourth day (chaturthi) of the month of Bhadrapada (August–September), the sixth month of 
      the Hindu calendar.At the start of the festival, idols of Ganesha are placed on raised platforms 
      in homes or in elaborately decorated outdoor tents. The worship begins with the pranapratishtha, 
      a ritual to invoke life in the idols, followed by shhodashopachara, or the 16 ways of paying tribute.
       Amid the chanting of Vedic hymns from religious texts like the Ganesh Upanishad, the idols are anointed
        with red sandalwood paste and yellow and red flowers. Ganesha is also offered coconut, jaggery,
         and 21 modaks (sweet dumplings), considered to be Ganesha’s favourite food.At the conclusion of
          the festival, the idols are carried to local rivers in huge processions accompanied by drumbeats,
           devotional singing, and dancing. There they are immersed, a ritual symbolizing Ganesha’s 
           homeward journey to Mount Kailas—the abode of his parents, Shiva and Parvati.

Ganesh Chaturthi assumed the nature of a gala public celebration when the Maratha ruler Shivaji
 (c. 1630–80) used it to encourage nationalist sentiment among his subjects, who were fighting 
 the Mughals. In 1893, when the British banned political assemblies, the festival was revived by the
  Indian nationalist leader Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Today the festival is celebrated in Hindu communities
   worldwide and is particularly popular in Maharashtra and parts of western India.

          Ganesh Visarjan
          </h1>
        <h3>
          On the last day of the festival, the tradition of Ganesh Visarjan takes place. The concluding day of 
          the 10-day festival is also popularly known as Anant Chaturdashi. As the word 'visarjan' implies, 
          on this day immersion ('visarjan' means immersion) of Lord Ganapati's idol takes place in a river,
           sea or water body. On the first day of the festival, the devotees mark the beginning of Ganesh
            Chaturthi with the placement of Lord Ganesha's idol in their homes, public places and offices.
             On the last day, the devotees come out in processions carrying the idols of their beloved God
              and perform immersion.There is an interesting story behind the legend of Ganesh visarjan.
               It is believed that Lord Ganesha returns to Mount Kailash to join his parents Lord Shiva
                and Goddess Parvati on the last day of the festival. The celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi
                 also denotes the significance of the cycle of birth, life and death. Ganesha, who is also
                  known as the Lord of New Beginnings, is also worshipped as the Remover of Obstacles.
                   It is believed that when the idol of the Ganesha is taken out for immersion, it also
                    takes away with it the various obstacles of the house and these obstacles are destroyed 
                    along with the visarjan.
Every year, people wait with great anticipation to celebrate the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi.
 And like always, we also hope that this year too, the Remover of Obstacles will shower us with his blessings
  and wipe out all the struggles from our life.
